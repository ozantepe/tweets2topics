583406140089839616,2015-04-01 23:10:37,@peterwilliams21 the shouting at the box is often being hard on myself and doing  in their direction like today saying I'm returning shitty

263613328650297344,2012-10-31 12:08:09,@tomncollier its normally the best physically or tactically that wins the race
263613122047262720,2012-10-31 12:07:20,@tomncollier of course there is skill at the top end of all sports but in cycling it isn't the decisive factor in winning or losing
263608080590319617,2012-10-31 11:47:18,@mr_rossi_ sport now... And its up to the others to follow
263607923593314305,2012-10-31 11:46:41,@mr_rossi_ I agree if you read 2 lines of a 2 minute answer I gave it doesn't sound good. Cycling has the best anti doping programme in..
263602403012657152,2012-10-31 11:24:45,@mr_rossi_ maybe you can help me here? Do all cyclists have daily coaching on technique etc?
263602069791993857,2012-10-31 11:23:25,@mr_rossi_ I'm very aware of the skill and physical endurance required to be a top cyclist..Very very tough sport one of the toughest
263594117618081793,2012-10-31 10:51:49,@SimonWilliams21 was asked to compare 2 sports... I believe one is much more physically demanding and the other is more skillfully demanding
263593634862075904,2012-10-31 10:49:54,@SimonWilliams21 cycling one of the most physically demanding sports in the world... What did I say about drugs that was incorrect?

263295215505403904,2012-10-30 15:04:05,@MTBTR good idea:) could raise some money for bio passports across more sport!
263292851469811712,2012-10-30 14:54:42,@MTBTR knowing if any little choice of the wrong word or phrase will make you look like an idiot
263291977284583424,2012-10-30 14:51:13,@MTBTR I wasn't trying to say anything bad about cycling.. I was trying to compare the 2 sports in front of journalists which isn't easy!
263290902234165248,2012-10-30 14:46:57,"@MTBTR I don't think it is ""just"" physical as I'm sure I would hit the deck cycling at 60mph however I believe it is a very large part of it"
263289601228148736,2012-10-30 14:41:47,@MTBTR ideally every sport would have a bio passport....
263288367586889728,2012-10-30 14:36:53,@MTBTR so no sport requires more or less skill than another one? And no sport is more or less physical than another?
263286794009853952,2012-10-30 14:30:37,@MTBTR didn't doubt for one second that the testing in cycling is better than tennis.. I said there needs to be much more testing in tennis
263286391931289600,2012-10-30 14:29:02,@MTBTR however I believe there is more skill involved in tennis...and I said that there needs to be much more testing in tennis...
263285555117309953,2012-10-30 14:25:42,@MTBTR long distance cycling is physically one of the hardest sports out there.. Without doubt more demanding than tennis...
